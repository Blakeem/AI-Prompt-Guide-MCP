# Workflow: Document Internal Feature Specification

1. [Agent] Gather initial requirements from user:
   â€¢ Feature purpose and goals
   â€¢ User-facing behavior expectations
   â€¢ Key use cases
   â€¢ Priorities

2. [Agent] Analyze requirements for gaps and ambiguities:
   â€¢ Unclear user flows or interactions
   â€¢ Missing UX details (inputs, outputs, feedback)
   â€¢ Undefined edge cases or error scenarios
   â€¢ Ambiguous feature scope or boundaries

**LOOP: While gaps or ambiguities exist**
â”œâ”€ 3. [Agent] Ask user clarifying questions:
â”‚  â€¢ UX details: How should users interact with this?
â”‚  â€¢ Requirements: What happens when X occurs?
â”‚  â€¢ Edge cases: How should system handle Y?
â”‚  â€¢ Priorities: Which aspects are most critical?
â”œâ”€ 4. [Agent] Use decide workflow for technical decisions:
â”‚  â€¢ Implementation approach
â”‚  â€¢ Data structures and storage
â”‚  â€¢ Integration patterns
â”‚  â€¢ Performance and security requirements
â”‚  â€¢ Technical trade-offs
â”œâ”€ 5. [Agent] Update requirements understanding
â””â”€ 6. IF gaps remain: GOTO step 3

7. [Agent] Use create_document to create specification document

8. [Agent] Use section tool to add complete specification:
   â€¢ Feature overview and rationale
   â€¢ Detailed functionality description
   â€¢ API endpoints/methods with signatures
   â€¢ Request/response formats with examples
   â€¢ Error conditions and messages
   â€¢ Edge cases and boundary conditions
   â€¢ Performance and security requirements
   â€¢ Add @references to external API specs (if integrating third-party services)
     Format: @/docs/specs/external-api-name or @/docs/specs/external-api#endpoint

9. [Agent] Document acceptance criteria:
   â€¢ Happy path: normal expected behavior
   â€¢ Edge cases: boundaries, limits, unusual inputs
   â€¢ Error handling: all error conditions
   â€¢ Performance boundaries: latency/throughput requirements
   â€¢ Security requirements: authentication, authorization, validation

10. [Agent] Document selected implementation approach from decide workflow

## Specification Principles

**Gap Analysis:**
- Identify unclear or missing requirements early
- Ask questions to avoid assumptions
- Clarify UX and user expectations with user
- Make technical decisions independently using decide workflow

**User vs Agent Decisions:**
- User decides: UX, feature scope, priorities, business rules
- Agent decides: Implementation, data structures, patterns, performance, security, technical trade-offs

**Clarity:**
- Clear, unambiguous requirements
- Complete coverage of functionality
- Specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- No assumptions without validation
