# Workflow: Document External API Specification

1. [Agent] Identify authoritative sources:
   â€¢ Official documentation, API references, RFCs
   â€¢ Versions relevant to runtime/environment
   â€¢ Verify current and accurate (not third-party tutorials)

2. [Agent] Extract complete API contract:
   â€¢ Capabilities: supported features, limitations
   â€¢ Invariants: must-hold conditions
   â€¢ Limits: rate limits, size limits, timeouts
   â€¢ Error semantics: codes, formats, retry policies
   â€¢ Version gates: feature availability per version
   â€¢ Authentication/authorization requirements

3. [Agent] Use create_document to create specification document

4. [Agent] Use section tool to add specification sections:
   â€¢ Endpoints/methods with full signatures
   â€¢ Request/response formats with examples
   â€¢ Error conditions and handling
   â€¢ Rate limits and quotas
   â€¢ Authentication flows
   â€¢ Version compatibility matrix

5. [Agent] Document integration acceptance criteria:
   â€¢ Happy path: normal expected behavior
   â€¢ Edge cases: boundaries, limits, unusual inputs
   â€¢ Error handling: all specified error conditions
   â€¢ Performance boundaries: latency/throughput requirements

## Specification Principles

**Correctness Priority:**
- Official documentation is source of truth
- Spec compliance before simplicity
- Test against specification, not assumptions
- Verify examples from official docs

**Documentation Quality:**
- Complete API surface coverage
- Clear examples for common use cases
- Comprehensive error documentation
- Version-specific notes where applicable
