# Workflow: Code Review

1. [Reviewer] Define review scope:
   ‚Ä¢ Pull request or commit range
   ‚Ä¢ Specific files or modules
   ‚Ä¢ Focused area or component

2. [Reviewer] Review across quality dimensions:
   ‚Ä¢ Correctness: logic accuracy, edge cases, error handling
   ‚Ä¢ Code Quality: readability, maintainability, naming
   ‚Ä¢ Testing: coverage, assertions, edge cases
   ‚Ä¢ Security: validation, auth, sensitive data handling
   ‚Ä¢ Performance: efficiency, resource usage
   ‚Ä¢ Pattern Consistency: aligns with codebase conventions

3. [Reviewer] Identify issues by severity:
   ‚Ä¢ Critical: security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking changes
   ‚Ä¢ High: performance issues, major logic errors, missing critical tests
   ‚Ä¢ Medium: code smells, moderate improvements, minor bugs
   ‚Ä¢ Low: style inconsistencies, minor optimizations, naming

4. [Reviewer] Provide actionable feedback per finding:
   ‚Ä¢ Location (file:line)
   ‚Ä¢ Clear description and impact
   ‚Ä¢ Concrete recommendation
   ‚Ä¢ Code examples (if applicable)

5. [Reviewer] Summarize findings:
   ‚Ä¢ Overall assessment (approve/request changes/comment)
   ‚Ä¢ Count by severity
   ‚Ä¢ Priority recommendations
   ‚Ä¢ Blocking vs non-blocking items

## Review Focus

**Prioritize:**
- Correctness and security
- Maintainability impact
- Changed code (not unchanged)

**Provide:**
- Specific, actionable feedback
- Explain "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices
- Timely feedback
