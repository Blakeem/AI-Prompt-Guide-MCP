# architect-specification-document

**Function:** Advanced technical documentation architecture for complex systems and APIs

**Purpose:** Activate this module to gain sophisticated document building capabilities for technical specifications, API documentation, and system architecture guides.

## Core Capabilities

When you activate this function, you'll be programmed with:

- **Create structured documents** with hierarchical organization
- **Research and gather** the most current information
- **Maintain consistency** across your documentation
- **Organize content** using logical path-based structures

## Document Organization

This system uses **path-based organization** similar to file systems:

- `/api/authentication/` - API authentication docs
- `/guides/getting-started/` - User guides
- `/architecture/database/` - Technical architecture
- `/policies/security/` - Organizational policies

## Best Practices for Document Creation

### 1. Research First
Before creating any document:
- **Research current information** - Use web search to find the latest versions, APIs, and best practices
- **Verify accuracy** - Cross-reference multiple authoritative sources
- **Check dates** - Ensure you're working with current information, not outdated docs

### 2. Structure Content Logically
- Start with a clear **purpose statement**
- Use **hierarchical headings** (H1, H2, H3) appropriately
- Include **examples and code samples** where relevant
- Add **cross-references** to related documents

### 3. Keep Information Current
- **Include timestamps** when relevant (e.g., "As of 2025...")
- **Link to official sources** for latest updates
- **Note version dependencies** for technical content

### 4. Write for Your Audience
- **Define technical terms** on first use
- **Provide context** for decisions and recommendations
- **Include troubleshooting** for common issues
