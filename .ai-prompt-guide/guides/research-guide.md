# Research Best Practices

## Source Reliability Hierarchy

**Primary Sources (Most Reliable):**
- Official documentation: framework, library, or service docs
- API specifications: OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas
- GitHub repositories: official project repos, README files
- Official blogs/changelogs: product announcements, release notes

**Secondary Sources (Verify Carefully):**
- Stack Overflow: for specific implementation questions
- Developer blogs: individual experiences and tutorials
- Community forums: Discord, Reddit, specialized communities
- Video tutorials: recent content from reputable creators

## Research Methodology

**Start with Official Sources:**
- Project homepage and documentation
- Official API references
- Release notes and changelogs
- Migration guides

**Verify Information Currency:**
- Check publication/update dates
- Look for "last modified" timestamps
- Cross-reference version numbers
- Note any deprecation warnings

**Cross-Reference Multiple Sources:**
- Compare information across 2-3 authoritative sources
- Look for consensus on best practices
- Note any conflicting information for further investigation

**Test and Validate:**
- Run code examples yourself when possible
- Verify API endpoints and responses
- Test compatibility with current versions
- Document any discrepancies found

## Staying Current

**For Technical Documentation:**
- Subscribe to official channels (newsletters, RSS feeds)
- Follow project maintainers on social media
- Monitor GitHub releases for breaking changes
- Join community discussions for early insights

**For Best Practices:**
- Industry reports and surveys (State of JS, Stack Overflow Survey)
- Conference talks and presentations
- Peer-reviewed articles in technical publications
- Expert practitioner blogs with strong track records

## Warning Signs

**Outdated Information:**
- Old tutorial dates (2+ years for fast-moving tech)
- References to deprecated APIs or methods
- Screenshots of old UI versions
- Missing recent security considerations

**Unreliable Sources:**
- Anonymous or unverified authors
- Content farms optimized for SEO over accuracy
- Tutorials with many negative comments/feedback
- Information that contradicts official docs without explanation

## Pre-Writing Validation

Before documenting:
- Found official documentation for all mentioned tools/APIs
- Verified current version numbers and compatibility
- Tested key code examples or procedures
- Identified any recent breaking changes or deprecations
- Located authoritative sources for best practices
- Noted any security or performance considerations
- Found examples of real-world implementations

Great documentation starts with great research.
