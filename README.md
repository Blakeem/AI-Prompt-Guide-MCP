# Spec-Docs MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables LLMs to manage interconnected specification documents through intelligent, progressive discovery workflows.

## The Problem

Traditional documentation management requires manual coordination between related documents, leading to:
- **Fragmented instructions** scattered across multiple markdown files
- **Missing context** when specifications reference other documents
- **Inconsistent implementations** due to incomplete information loading
- **Manual coordination** between documentation, specs, and implementation guides

## The Solution

Spec-Docs MCP provides a **linked document ecosystem** where:
- Specifications automatically **load related documents** into context
- **Progressive discovery** guides users through complex workflows step-by-step
- **Linked references** ensure all relevant information is available during tasks
- **Structured templates** create consistent, interconnected documentation

Think of it as a more powerful replacement for manual markdown management, where documents understand their relationships and guide development workflows intelligently.

## Status

ðŸ§ª **Alpha Testing** - Core MCP infrastructure, linking system, and view tools are implemented with comprehensive test coverage. Currently in alpha testing phase with real-world workflows. **Ready for testing** - feedback welcome from early adopters!

## Key Features

## Example Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Create API Spec] --> B[Progressive Discovery Guide]
    B --> C[Section Tool: Add Endpoints]
    C --> D[Section Tool: Batch Operations]
    D --> E[Manage Document: Archive Old Version]
    E --> F[Create Implementation Tasks]
    F --> G[Section Tool: Link References]
    G --> H[Complete Unified Documentation]
```

### Unified Tool Examples

```javascript
// Section tool - All operations in one
await section({
  document: "/api/user-service.md",
  section: "#authentication",
  content: "Updated auth flow...",
  operation: "replace"
});

// Batch section operations
await section([
  { document: "/api/spec.md", section: "#endpoints", content: "...", operation: "append" },
  { document: "/api/spec.md", section: "#new-feature", content: "...", operation: "insert_after", title: "New Feature" },
  { document: "/api/spec.md", section: "#deprecated", operation: "remove" }
]);

// Document management - All operations unified
await manage_document({
  operation: "archive",
  document: "/old-spec.md"
});
```

## Architecture

### Unified Tool Architecture
The server follows a "one tool, one purpose" philosophy with powerful, consolidated operations:

**Progressive Discovery Pattern:**
Tools reveal parameters gradually, guiding users through complex workflows:
- **Stage 0**: Discovery - Show available options
- **Stage 1**: Configuration - Gather specific requirements
- **Stage 2**: Creation - Execute with full context

**Unified Operations:**
- **`section` tool** - All section operations (create/edit/remove) with automatic depth calculation
- **`manage_document` tool** - All document operations (archive/delete/rename/move) with batch support
- **Batch Processing** - Multiple operations in a single call for efficiency

### Modular MCP Design
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ session/           # Session state management with singleton patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/       # Centralized schema definitions with examples
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ implementations/ # Individual tool logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ registry.ts    # Dynamic tool registration
â”œâ”€â”€ server/            # MCP protocol handling
â””â”€â”€ shared/            # Common utilities and helpers
```

### Document Linking System
- **Automatic Context Loading** - Referenced documents load when needed
- **Smart Templates** - Consistent structure across document types
- **Cross-Reference Validation** - Ensure linked documents exist and are current
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Installation & Setup

### For Claude Desktop Users

Add this to your `mcp.json` file to use the published package:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.modelcontextprotocol.io/0.1.0/mcp.json",
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-docs-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@blakeem/spec-docs-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DOCS_BASE_PATH": "./.spec-docs-mcp/docs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Required Configuration:**
- `DOCS_BASE_PATH` - Path to your documents directory (only required setting)

**Optional Configuration:**
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Set to `debug` for verbose logging (defaults to `info`)

The server uses sensible defaults for all other settings. Advanced users can override additional settings if needed, but for most users, only `DOCS_BASE_PATH` is required.

### For Development

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Blakeem/Spec-Docs-MCP.git
cd Spec-Docs-MCP
pnpm install && pnpm build

# Start MCP inspector for testing
pnpm inspector:dev

# Run quality gates
pnpm test:run && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
```

## Testing Progressive Discovery

1. **Start Inspector**: `pnpm inspector:dev`
2. **Call Tool**: Use `create_document` with empty parameters
3. **Manual Refresh**: Pull down or click refresh in tool list
