# AI Prompt Guide MCP

**MCP Server & Claude Code Plugin for Multi-Agent Workflows**

**Task-driven agent orchestration workflows with structured markdown knowledge graphs and intelligent context injection.**

A Model Context Protocol server that manages structured markdown knowledge graphs for AI agent orchestration. Assign tasks by path and the server injects the exact specs, workflows, and linked documents the agent needs‚Äîno manual prompt stitching, no repeated context dumps, and a persistent audit of everything completed.

## Overview

AI projects stall when agents need to be micromanaged with copy-pasted specs, decision frameworks, and status updates. AI Prompt Guide MCP removes that friction with structured markdown knowledge graphs that form a navigable, deterministic system subagents can explore on demand.

### Key Capabilities
- Task-driven context loading (`start_task`, `complete_task`) that automatically injects linked documentation, workflows, and follow-up tasks.
- Unified @reference system that loads only the sections each task needs, with configurable depth, cycle detection, and namespace-aware addressing.
- Workflow library that surfaces project methodologies (‚ÄúMain-Workflow‚Äù) and task-specific playbooks (‚ÄúWorkflow‚Äù) without re-prompting.
- Progressive tool suite for creating, browsing, editing, and moving documents, sections, and tasks in batches.
- Persistent audit trail that captures completion notes and next steps across sessions.

### Why It Exists
- Eliminate manual orchestration between agents.
- Preserve context across compression cycles.
- Keep documentation, workflows, and tasks synchronized as a single system.
- Provide deterministic, explainable context engineering.

## Core Concepts

### Knowledge Graph Orchestration

Documents, sections, and tasks form a multi-layer knowledge graph that the server navigates for you. Each `@/path/doc.md#section` reference loads the exact subsection required and recursively resolves its own references until the configured depth is reached (default: 3, max: 5). Cycle detection, node limits, and a 30-second timeout prevent runaway traversals.

```
Task: "Configure API Gateway"
‚îî‚îÄ @/api/gateway.md (depth 0)
   ‚îú‚îÄ @/api/auth.md (depth 1)
   ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ @/security/jwt.md (depth 2)
   ‚îî‚îÄ @/api/rate-limiting.md (depth 1)
```

Namespaces (for example `/api/`, `/guides/`, `/specs/`) keep large ecosystems organized, and flat slug addressing (`#overview`, `#task-1`) ensures link stability even when sections repeat across documents.

### Context Workflow Engine

Tool choice communicates session intent, so the server can deliver the right amount of context every time:

| Tool            | Purpose                                  | Injects                                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `view_task`     | Browse tasks without starting work        | Titles, status, hierarchy (no workflows or references)                |
| `start_task`    | Begin new work or resume after compression| Task workflow, optional main workflow, hierarchical references        |
| `complete_task` | Finish current task and get the next one  | Completion receipt, next task + workflow + references (no main workflow) |

Use `start_task` whenever a session restarts; it re-injects the project‚Äôs main methodology. Stick with `complete_task` while working continuously to avoid duplicate main workflow prompts.

### Workflow Types

Two metadata fields control workflow injection:

- **Main-Workflow** ‚Äì Project-level methodology defined in the first task of a document. Reappears only when work restarts (e.g., after compression or new session). Options:
  - `tdd-incremental-orchestration` ‚Äì For production-quality development with test-first discipline and quality gates
  - `manual-verification-orchestration` ‚Äì For zero-shot projects, prototypes, or when test infrastructure isn't available
- **Workflow** ‚Äì Task-level guidance. Injected every time the task is addressed. Useful options include `spec-first-integration`, `multi-option-tradeoff`, `failure-triage-repro`, and `code-review-issue-based`.

Example task definition:

```markdown
### Design API Architecture
- Status: pending
- Main-Workflow: tdd-incremental-orchestration   # project methodology (first task only)
- Workflow: spec-first-integration              # task-specific process

Design the REST API architecture.

@/specs/api-requirements.md
@/architecture/patterns.md
```

## Tool Suite

The server exposes 16 MCP tools grouped by workflow stage. Every tool uses unified addressing (`/doc.md#slug`) and context-aware responses.

### Document Discovery & Navigation
- `create_document` ‚Äì Progressive discovery flow that helps you choose a namespace and create a blank document with title and overview.
- `browse_documents` ‚Äì Navigate document hierarchy and list folders/documents with basic metadata.
- `search_documents` ‚Äì Full-text or regex search across all document content with match highlighting, line numbers, and contextual snippets.

### Content & Task Editing
- `section` ‚Äì Batch edit, append, insert, or remove sections across one or many documents while preserving structure.
- `task` ‚Äì Create, edit, or list tasks with optional cross-document operations, status filtering, and reference extraction.

### Task Execution Helpers
- `start_task` ‚Äì Load workflows and referenced docs to kick off (or resume) work with full context.
- `complete_task` ‚Äì Mark work finished, capture completion notes, and queue the next actionable task.

### View & Inspection
- `view_document` ‚Äì Complete document structure showing ALL sections (slug, title, depth) with comprehensive metadata including link statistics, task counts, and word counts.
- `view_section` ‚Äì Section-specific content viewer with two modes: overview (titles only) or detailed content retrieval for specific sections.
- `view_task` ‚Äì Task-specific viewer with two modes: overview (metadata only) or detailed content with workflows and reference trees.

### Document Lifecycle
- `edit_document` ‚Äì Update a document's title and overview without touching section structure.
- `delete_document` ‚Äì Permanently delete or archive with timestamped audit trail.
- `move` ‚Äì Relocate sections or tasks within or across documents with safe "create before delete" semantics.
- `move_document` ‚Äì Move entire documents to new namespaces with automatic directory creation.

### Workflow & Guide Access
- `get_workflow` ‚Äì Retrieve structured workflow protocol content with metadata (description, when_to_use, tags). Available workflows visible in tool enum.
- `get_guide` ‚Äì Access documentation and research best practice guides. Available guides visible in tool enum.

**Design principles:** Context-aware operations, batch-friendly APIs, and deterministic behavior even in large documentation sets.

## Workflows & Guides

### Tool-Based Access

Workflows and guides are accessed via two MCP tools that expose all available options in their enum schemas:

- **`get_workflow`** ‚Äì Retrieve workflow protocols with structured metadata
- **`get_guide`** ‚Äì Access documentation and research best practices

Both tools load content from Markdown files at startup:

```
.ai-prompt-guide/workflows/ ‚Üí Workflow protocols (e.g., tdd-incremental-orchestration)
.ai-prompt-guide/guides/    ‚Üí Documentation guides (e.g., activate-specification-documentation)
```

Logs confirm loading:

```
[INFO] Loading workflow prompts from directory { directory: '/workflows', fileCount: 6, prefix: 'workflow_' }
[INFO] Loading workflow prompts from directory { directory: '/guides', fileCount: 4, prefix: 'guide_' }
[INFO] Workflow prompts loaded from all directories { loaded: 10, failed: 0, directories: 2 }
```

**Discovery**: All available workflows and guides are visible in the tool enum schemas‚Äîno separate list command needed.

### File Format

Workflows and guides are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "My Custom Workflow"
description: "üéØ Brief description of what this workflow does"
whenToUse:
  - "When facing situation A"
  - "When needing to accomplish goal B"
  - "When dealing with constraint C"
---

# My Custom Workflow

## Purpose
Explain why this workflow exists and what problem it solves.

## Process

1. **Step 1: [Action]**
   - Detail A
   - Detail B
   - Consideration C

2. **Step 2: [Action]**
   - Detail A
   - Detail B

## Example
Concrete example showing the workflow in action...

## Common Pitfalls
- ‚ùå **Pitfall 1**: Why it's wrong
  - ‚úÖ **Instead**: What to do
```

### Using Workflows in Tasks

Reference workflows directly in task metadata‚Äîthe system automatically looks them up:

```markdown
### Implement Authentication
- Status: pending
- Workflow: spec-first-integration
- Main-Workflow: tdd-incremental-orchestration

Implement JWT authentication following the API spec.

@/specs/auth-api.md
```

`start_task` and `complete_task` extract these names, load the workflow content via the internal workflow system, and inject full methodology alongside referenced documents.

You can also access workflows directly using `get_workflow({ workflow: "spec-first-integration" })` for reference during planning or decision-making phases.

### Create Your Own

1. Create a Markdown file in `.ai-prompt-guide/workflows/` (for process workflows) or `.ai-prompt-guide/guides/` (for documentation guides). Use lowercase, descriptive filenames (`my-team-process.md`, `code_review_checklist.md`).
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `title`, `description`, and `whenToUse`, followed by structured Markdown content.
3. Restart the server (`pnpm build && npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js`) or reload your MCP client so the new workflow is detected.
4. Check the tool enum: workflows appear in `get_workflow` enum, guides in `get_guide` enum (e.g., `my-team-process`).
5. Access via `get_workflow({ workflow: "my-team-process" })` or reference the workflow name from any task.

### Built-In Workflows & Guides

The repository includes **six workflow protocols** (accessible via `get_workflow`):
- `code-review-issue-based` ‚Äì Parallel code review with specialized agents
- `failure-triage-repro` ‚Äì Bug triage and minimal reproduction
- `manual-verification-orchestration` ‚Äì Manual verification for zero-shot/iterative tasks (no test infrastructure required)
- `multi-option-tradeoff` ‚Äì Structured decision analysis
- `spec-first-integration` ‚Äì API/integration correctness workflow
- `tdd-incremental-orchestration` ‚Äì TDD-driven development with quality gates

and **four documentation guides** (accessible via `get_guide`):
- `tutorial-writing` ‚Äì How to write actionable guides and tutorials
- `specification-writing` ‚Äì Technical specification writing
- `writing-standards` ‚Äì Content organization and writing standards
- `research-guide` ‚Äì Research methodology and validation

Access any workflow with: `get_workflow({ workflow: "workflow-name" })`
Access any guide with: `get_guide({ guide: "guide-name" })`

Consult `docs/WORKFLOW-PROMPTS.md` for detailed descriptions and authoring guidance.

## Claude Code Plugin

The Claude Code plugin bundles this MCP server with guided slash commands and specialized subagents so you can launch complex workflows in one message.

### Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Blakeem/AI-Prompt-Guide-MCP
/plugin install ai-prompt-guide
```

Use `/plugin list` to confirm installation or `/plugin update ai-prompt-guide` to pull the latest version.

### Slash Commands

Each command wraps an MCP workflow and expects a follow-up message, for example `/ai-prompt-guide:build-tdd Implement the new dashboard with tests`. Available commands:
- `/ai-prompt-guide:build-tdd` ‚Äì Build feature/component/app with TDD workflow (test-driven development with quality gates).
- `/ai-prompt-guide:build-iterate` ‚Äì Build feature/component/app with manual verification for zero-shot/iterative tasks (no test infrastructure required).
- `/ai-prompt-guide:fix` ‚Äì Run the failure triage workflow to isolate and resolve a bug.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:refactor` ‚Äì Plan and execute refactoring with quantitative trade-off analysis.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:review` ‚Äì Launch a targeted code review using the review subagent.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:audit` ‚Äì Perform a comprehensive quality audit across the codebase.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:coverage` ‚Äì Add or improve automated test coverage.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:decide` ‚Äì Compare multiple approaches with structured decision analysis.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:spec-feature` ‚Äì Draft internal specifications before implementation.
- `/ai-prompt-guide:spec-external` ‚Äì Research and document third-party APIs or dependencies.

### Subagents

- **Code Subagent** ‚Äì Implementation specialist covering feature work, debugging, refactoring, testing, and documentation.
- **Review Subagent** ‚Äì Quality and risk analyst focused on correctness, security, performance, and architectural concerns.

Slash commands automatically route work to the right subagent and inject the corresponding workflows and reference material.

### Example Usage

**TDD Workflow (with tests):**
```
/ai-prompt-guide:build-tdd Ship an admin dashboard that surfaces active-user trends, includes filtering by region, and exposes download-ready CSV exports. Make sure tests cover the aggregation logic.
```

**Iterative Workflow (manual verification):**
```
/ai-prompt-guide:build-iterate Create a landing page for the product with hero section, features list, and contact form. I'll test it manually in the browser.
```

The plugin will create a structured plan, spin up specialized subagents with appropriate orchestration workflows, and load any referenced documents or workflows automatically.

### Project-Specific Configuration

When working on multiple projects with the Claude Code plugin, create a `.mcp-config.json` file in each project root to override default paths:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DOCS_BASE_PATH": ".ai-prompt-guide/docs",
    "WORKFLOWS_BASE_PATH": ".ai-prompt-guide/workflows",
    "GUIDES_BASE_PATH": ".ai-prompt-guide/guides"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Precedence:**
1. `.mcp-config.json` (project root) ‚Äì highest priority
2. Plugin defaults ‚Äì fallback

**Path Resolution:**
- Relative paths resolve from project root (where `claude` command runs)
- Absolute paths used as-is
- Missing paths: docs required (throws error), workflows/guides optional (log warning)

This allows each project to maintain its own documentation while sharing the plugin's workflows and guides, or customize all three independently.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- pnpm 10.x (the project uses pnpm workspaces and lockfiles)

### Install & Build

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

This compiles the TypeScript source into `dist/` and prepares the executable `ai-prompt-guide-mcp`.

### Run the Server

From a local clone:

```bash
# Development with hot reload
pnpm dev

# Production build
pnpm start          # after pnpm build

# Inspector-driven testing
pnpm build && pnpm inspector
```

You can also launch the published package directly:

```bash
npx -y ai-prompt-guide-mcp
```

### Configuration

Environment variables (set in MCP client config or via `.mcp-config.json`):

- `DOCS_BASE_PATH` (required): Root directory for managed documents, e.g. `./.ai-prompt-guide/docs`
- `WORKFLOWS_BASE_PATH` (optional): Directory for workflow protocols (defaults to plugin's bundled workflows)
- `GUIDES_BASE_PATH` (optional): Directory for documentation guides (defaults to plugin's bundled guides)
- `REFERENCE_EXTRACTION_DEPTH` (optional, default `3`): Recursive @reference depth from `1` (direct only) to `5` (maximum)
- `LOG_LEVEL` (optional, default `info`): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`

For project-specific overrides when using the Claude Code plugin, see [Project-Specific Configuration](#project-specific-configuration).

Out-of-range depth values default to `3`. Cycle detection and node limits keep reference loading safe regardless of configuration.

### Directory Structure

```
.ai-prompt-guide/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                     # Documents managed by the MCP tools (required)

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specification-writing.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ writing-standards.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ research-guide.md
```

`docs/` feeds the MCP tools, while `workflows/` and `guides/` load at startup and become accessible via the `get_workflow` and `get_guide` tools.

## Codex & Other MCP Clients

Any MCP client that accepts a JSON configuration can launch the server. Point the client to the CLI entry point and pass environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-prompt-guide-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ai-prompt-guide-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DOCS_BASE_PATH": "./.ai-prompt-guide/docs",
        "WORKFLOWS_BASE_PATH": "./.ai-prompt-guide/workflows",
        "GUIDES_BASE_PATH": "./.ai-prompt-guide/guides",
        "REFERENCE_EXTRACTION_DEPTH": "3",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use `.mcp-config.json` in your project root for per-project path overrides (see [Project-Specific Configuration](#project-specific-configuration)).

### Codex CLI Workflow

1. Clone the repository and build it locally (`pnpm install && pnpm build`).
2. Add an entry to your Codex MCP configuration referencing `node dist/index.js` (or the published `npx` command above).
3. Export `DOCS_BASE_PATH` (and optionally `WORKFLOWS_BASE_PATH`/`GUIDES_BASE_PATH`) or create `.mcp-config.json` in project root.
4. Validate the connection with `pnpm inspector` or `npx --yes @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js`.

Codex and most other MCP clients watch for the `bin` executable, so once the server is built you can point directly at the generated binary without additional glue code.
