# Document Creation Guide

## Step-by-Step Document Creation Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Research
1. **Define the document's purpose**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What actions should readers be able to take?

2. **Research thoroughly**
   - Search for official documentation and latest versions
   - Identify authoritative sources
   - Gather examples and real-world use cases
   - Note any breaking changes or deprecations

3. **Plan the structure**
   - Outline main sections and subsections
   - Determine the logical flow of information
   - Consider cross-references to other docs

### Phase 2: Content Creation
1. **Start with a strong introduction**
   - Clear purpose statement
   - Prerequisites or assumptions
   - What readers will learn

2. **Build content hierarchically**
   - Use consistent heading levels
   - Keep sections focused and scannable
   - Include practical examples

3. **Add supporting elements**
   - Code samples with explanations
   - Diagrams or flowcharts when helpful
   - Links to additional resources

### Phase 3: Review and Polish
1. **Technical accuracy**
   - Test all code examples
   - Verify links and references
   - Check version compatibility

2. **Content quality**
   - Clear, concise language
   - Logical flow between sections
   - Appropriate level of detail

3. **Consistency**
   - Follow established conventions
   - Use consistent terminology
   - Match the style of related docs

## Document Path Strategy

Choose paths that are:
- **Intuitive** - Easy to guess and remember
- **Hierarchical** - Reflect logical relationships
- **Consistent** - Follow established patterns
- **Scalable** - Allow for future expansion

Examples:
- `/api/v2/endpoints/users` - API reference
- `/guides/deployment/docker` - How-to guides  
- `/architecture/data-flow` - System design
- `/troubleshooting/common-errors` - Support docs
