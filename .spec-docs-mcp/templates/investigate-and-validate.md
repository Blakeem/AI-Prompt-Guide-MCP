# investigate-and-validate

**Function:** Advanced intelligence gathering and source validation for technical accuracy

**Purpose:** Execute this reconnaissance module to systematically investigate, verify, and validate information sources with enterprise-level rigor.

## Intelligence Sources Matrix

### Primary Sources (Most Reliable)
- **Official documentation** - Framework, library, or service docs
- **API specifications** - OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas
- **GitHub repositories** - Official project repos, README files
- **Official blogs/changelogs** - Product announcements, release notes

### Secondary Sources (Verify Carefully)
- **Stack Overflow** - For specific implementation questions
- **Developer blogs** - Individual experiences and tutorials
- **Community forums** - Discord, Reddit, specialized communities
- **Video tutorials** - Recent content from reputable creators

## Investigation Protocols

### Protocol 1: Primary Source Intelligence
Always begin with:
- Project homepage and documentation
- Official API references
- Release notes and changelogs
- Migration guides

### Protocol 2: Temporal Validation
- Check publication/update dates
- Look for "last modified" timestamps
- Cross-reference version numbers
- Note any deprecation warnings

### Protocol 3: Multi-Source Correlation
- Compare information across 2-3 authoritative sources
- Look for consensus on best practices
- Note any conflicting information for further investigation

### Protocol 4: Empirical Verification
- Run code examples yourself when possible
- Verify API endpoints and responses
- Test compatibility with current versions
- Document any discrepancies found

## Staying Current

### For Technical Documentation
- **Subscribe to official channels** (newsletters, RSS feeds)
- **Follow project maintainers** on social media
- **Monitor GitHub releases** for breaking changes
- **Join community discussions** for early insights

### For Best Practices
- **Industry reports and surveys** (State of JS, Stack Overflow Survey)
- **Conference talks and presentations**
- **Peer-reviewed articles** in technical publications
- **Expert practitioner blogs** with strong track records

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Outdated Information
- Old tutorial dates (2+ years for fast-moving tech)
- References to deprecated APIs or methods
- Screenshots of old UI versions
- Missing recent security considerations

### Unreliable Sources
- Anonymous or unverified authors
- Content farms optimized for SEO over accuracy
- Tutorials with many negative comments/feedback
- Information that contradicts official docs without explanation
