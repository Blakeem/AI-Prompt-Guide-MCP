## 2025-09-27 — addressing-system.ts — M1-M3 — Subagent-Addressing

### Classification Decision
**Main Agent Suggested:** Issue #1: Type B (Architecture/Quality), Issue #2: Type A (Runtime/Functional)
**Subagent Decision:** **Confirmed Both Classifications**
**Reasoning:**
- Code examination revealed: Issue #1 is indeed a type safety violation using unsafe type assertion `error.context['slug'] as string` instead of proper type guards
- Issue #2 is definitively Type A - the LRU cache uses `keys().next().value` which gives insertion order, not access order, leading to unbounded memory growth under sustained load
- Key factors that influenced decision: Issue #1 violates TypeScript type safety principles (Type B quality issue), Issue #2 causes functional runtime problems with memory leaks and poor cache efficiency (Type A runtime issue)
- Confidence in decision: **High** - Classifications align perfectly with issue characteristics and observable impacts

---

### Summary (Technical)

**Issue Type:** Mixed - 1 Type B (Architecture/Quality) + 1 Type A (Runtime/Functional)

**Root Cause:**
- **Type B Issue (#1):** `formatHierarchicalError` method uses unsafe type assertion `error.context['slug'] as string` instead of proper type guards, creating runtime type safety risks when error context doesn't match expected structure
- **Type A Issue (#2):** AddressCache LRU implementation uses `keys().next().value` which doesn't guarantee true LRU order - Map iteration order is insertion order, not access order, causing potential memory leaks under sustained load

**Solution Approach:**
- **Type B (#1):** Implemented proper type guard `hasSectionContext()` to safely check error context structure before accessing properties, replacing unsafe type assertion with type-safe validation
- **Type A (#2):** Implemented proper LRU with access tracking using `touch()` method that re-inserts accessed items to maintain true access order, preventing cache from exceeding size limits and ensuring efficient eviction

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/addressing-system.ts` - Enhanced error formatting with type guards and fixed LRU cache implementation:
  - Added `hasSectionContext()` type guard for safe error context access
  - Updated `formatHierarchicalError()` to use type guards instead of unsafe assertions
  - Implemented proper LRU with `touch()` method for true access-order tracking
  - Enhanced cache eviction logic to prevent unbounded growth
- `src/shared/__tests__/addressing-system.lru.test.ts` - Created comprehensive LRU cache test suite

**Interfaces Touched:**
- Public API changes: **None** - All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Internal structure changes:
  - Added `hasSectionContext()` static method to ToolIntegration class
  - Added private `touch()` method to AddressCache for LRU maintenance
  - Enhanced cache access methods to automatically touch accessed items

---

### Evidence & Verification

**Type-Specific Evidence:**
- **Type B (#1)** Code quality improvements: Replaced unsafe type assertion with proper type guard pattern, ensuring runtime type safety
- **Type A (#2)** LRU cache tests: Created 6 comprehensive tests demonstrating proper access order maintenance and eviction behavior
- **Type A (#2)** Memory leak prevention: Cache now properly maintains maxSize limit through true LRU eviction

**Quality Gates:**
```bash
pnpm test:run        ✅ 319 tests passed (including new LRU tests)
pnpm lint            ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
pnpm typecheck       ✅ 0 type errors
pnpm check:dead-code ✅ 0 unused exports
pnpm check:all       ✅ all checks passed
```

**Summary:**
- ✅ No new issues introduced
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Enhanced type safety and memory management

---

### Shared Patterns / Tips for Future Agents

**Reusable Patterns:**
- **Type Guard Pattern**: Use `function hasProperty(obj: unknown): obj is { property: type }` for safe property access instead of type assertions
- **LRU Touch Pattern**: Implement `touch()` method that deletes and re-inserts items to maintain true access order in Map-based LRU caches
- **Cache Size Protection**: Always check `!cache.has(key)` before size limit to avoid evicting when updating existing entries
- **Type-Safe Error Handling**: Use type guards to validate error context structure before accessing nested properties

**Gotchas Discovered:**
- **JavaScript Map LRU**: Maps maintain insertion order, not access order - need explicit touch operations for true LRU
- **TypeScript Non-Null Assertions**: ESLint forbids `!` assertions - use explicit null checks with proper error handling
- **Cache Eviction Logic**: Must check if key exists before checking size limit to avoid unnecessary evictions on updates
- **Error Context Validation**: Error contexts can vary in structure - always validate before accessing properties

**Decision-Making Notes:**
- **Type Guard vs Type Assertion**: Chose type guards for runtime safety over type assertions for developer convenience
- **Touch vs Dedicated LRU Library**: Chose touch pattern for simplicity and control over external dependency
- **Cache Structure**: Maintained existing Map-based approach with enhancement rather than full replacement

**Performance/Stability Notes:**
- Touch operations add minimal overhead (delete + set) for significant memory safety gains
- Type guards provide runtime safety without performance impact in normal operation
- LRU implementation prevents unbounded memory growth under sustained cache load

---

### Bad Practice Observed (Flag + Reason)

**Pattern Found:** `Using unsafe type assertions (error.context['slug'] as string) instead of proper type guards`
**Why Problematic:** Violates TypeScript's type safety guarantees, can cause runtime errors if context structure differs from expectations, makes code brittle to interface changes
**Suggested Replacement:** `Implement type guards: function hasProperty(obj: unknown): obj is { property: type } for safe property access`
**Reference:** Fixed in formatHierarchicalError method with hasSectionContext type guard

**Pattern Found:** `Using Map iteration order for LRU cache eviction (keys().next().value)`
**Why Problematic:** JavaScript Maps maintain insertion order, not access order, leading to eviction of frequently used items while unused items remain, causing memory leaks and poor cache efficiency
**Suggested Replacement:** `Implement proper LRU with touch pattern: delete and re-insert accessed items to maintain true access order`
**Reference:** Fixed in AddressCache with touch() method for both document and section caches

**Pattern Found:** `Array access without null checking in tests (array[index]!)`
**Why Problematic:** Non-null assertions are forbidden by ESLint strict rules, can mask potential runtime errors, makes code less defensive
**Suggested Replacement:** `Use explicit null checks: const item = array[index]; if (item != null) { use(item); }`
**Reference:** Fixed throughout LRU test file with proper null checking patterns

### Learning & Improvement

**What Worked Well:**
- **Test-Driven LRU Fix**: Created comprehensive test suite first to demonstrate LRU issues, then implemented fix to make tests pass
- **Type Guard Implementation**: Clear separation of type validation logic into dedicated methods improved readability and reusability
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Running quality gates after each change caught TypeScript and linting issues immediately
- **Systematic Approach**: Following the [edit-build-test] loop ensured no regressions while implementing fixes

**What Was Challenging:**
- **ESLint Strict Rules**: Balancing TypeScript strict null checking with ESLint non-null assertion rules required careful null handling patterns
- **LRU Access Order**: Understanding the difference between Map insertion order and true LRU access order required deep investigation
- **Type Guard Design**: Ensuring type guards were comprehensive enough to catch all edge cases while remaining maintainable

**Recommendations for Workflow Improvement:**
- **Add Type Safety Review Step**: Include type assertion audit in code review checklist
- **LRU Pattern Documentation**: Document the touch pattern for future LRU implementations
- **Test-First Cache Development**: Always test cache behavior with comprehensive scenarios before considering implementation complete
