# Add Test Coverage

## User Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Approach

Add tests to existing untested code:
- Analyze code to understand functionality and critical paths
- Prioritize high-value test cases (complex logic, critical flows, edge cases)
- Follow project test patterns and conventions
- Write clear, maintainable tests using Arrange-Act-Assert
- Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions

Use create_document and task tools for tracking test implementation work.
