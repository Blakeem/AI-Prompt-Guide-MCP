$ARGUMENTS

## Task Overview

Evaluate multiple implementation approaches and choose the best one using structured, quantitative analysis.

## Workflow (**REQUIRED**)

Use the **multi-option-tradeoff** workflow via the `get_workflow` tool:
```typescript
get_workflow({ workflow: "multi-option-tradeoff" })
```

This is one of the most powerful decision-making tools available. Use it whenever you face uncertainty about implementation approaches.

## Deliverables

- 2-4 documented options with full analysis
- Quantitative comparison matrix
- Clear decision with justification
- Explanation of why other options were rejected
- Documented trade-offs and assumptions
