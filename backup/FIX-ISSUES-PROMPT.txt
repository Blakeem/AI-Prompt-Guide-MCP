We will be completing all the rest of the MAJOR issues using the that we have not completed yet. Here are the steps are are following using the `ISSUE-RESOLUTION-WORKFLOW.md`. Please read any files (such as `ISSUE-RESOLUTION-WORKFLOW.md`) that are needed so you can make a complete plan to finish all MAJOR issues that have not yet been addressed.

1. Split up work based on what file the subagents will touch and create a TODOWrite list. We want to make sure it's something a single subagent can work at once to better allow test driven development testing on those methods without other problems getting in the way.
2. Share the work details to the subagent along with what file(s) they will responsible and what the titles of what issues are that they will be working on. Have them read `CODE-REVIEW-PLAN.md` to understand the full scope of work and how what we are working on overlaps. They must also be asked to first read `ISSUE-RESOLUTION-AGENT-MEMORY.md` so that they can see what subagents have already done before, and so we keep with best practice and learn from eachother over time.
3. Each subagent will be assigned work that they will be able to complete in one go, while avoiding overlapping issues. You are the orchestrating main agent. Once an agent is complete, run `git diff --stat` and think about the changes and if they are expected. If so, run `git add --all` to stage changes for the next subagent. If they are not expected, STOP THE RUN and let me know what happened so we can work on it together. This review will also allow you to keep track in case anything happens in a file that is not expected, or anything rolls back changes that we staged. The subagents should not be told anything regarding git, this will be your responsibility.
4. Once all issue are resolved, please provide a list of anything new that we must address or that was discovered in this process so that I'm aware. You can gather this by reading the `ISSUE-RESOLUTION-AGENT-MEMORY.md` at the very end.

Lets think hard though this process so that we can make sure it's a success. You should work as long as it takes, as long as you don't run into any STOP issues that we should work on together. Thank you!
