# Welcome Gate Implementation - Testing Guide

## Overview

The "Welcome Gate" pattern has been successfully implemented in your Spec-Docs MCP server. This pattern ensures users/LLMs must acknowledge a welcome message before accessing the full tool suite.

## How It Works

### 1. Initial State (Not Acknowledged)
When you first connect to the server, you'll see:
- **Tools Available**: 
  - `test_connection` - Always available
  - `acknowledge_setup` - The gateway tool
- **Prompts Available**:
  - `welcome` - The onboarding message

### 2. The Flow
1. **Read Welcome**: Call the `welcome` prompt to see instructions
2. **Acknowledge**: Call the `acknowledge_setup` tool 
3. **Lists Change**: Server sends `list_changed` notifications
4. **Refresh Lists**: Client re-fetches tool/prompt lists
5. **New Tools Appear**: `test_tool` is now available

### 3. After Acknowledgment
- All original tools remain available
- New tool `test_tool` is unlocked
- Acknowledgment is remembered per session
- Calling `acknowledge_setup` again is safe (idempotent)

## Testing in MCP Inspector

### Step 1: Connect to Server
```bash
# In one terminal, start the server:
pnpm build && node dist/index.js

# In browser, open MCP Inspector and connect to stdio
```

### Step 2: Initial Tool Check
1. Click "Tools" tab → Reload
2. You should see only:
   - `test_connection`
   - `acknowledge_setup`

### Step 3: Read Welcome Prompt
1. Click "Prompts" tab → Reload
2. You should see `welcome` prompt
3. Click on it to read the instructions

### Step 4: Acknowledge Setup
1. Go back to "Tools" tab
2. Click `acknowledge_setup` tool
3. Click "Run" (no parameters needed)
4. You'll see a success message with timestamp

### Step 5: Check Notifications
Look in the console/logs for:
```
Sending list_changed notifications
```

### Step 6: Refresh Tool List
1. **Important**: Click "Reload" in the Tools tab
2. You should now see THREE tools:
   - `test_connection`
   - `acknowledge_setup` 
   - `test_tool` ← NEW!

### Step 7: Test the Gated Tool
1. Click on `test_tool`
2. Optionally add a message parameter
3. Run it - you'll get "Gate passed!" response

## Testing via JSON-RPC (Manual)

```bash
# 1. List initial tools (only 2)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | node dist/index.js

# 2. Get welcome prompt
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"prompts/get","params":{"name":"welcome"}}' | node dist/index.js

# 3. Acknowledge setup
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"acknowledge_setup","arguments":{}}}' | node dist/index.js

# 4. List tools again (now 3!)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/list"}' | node dist/index.js

# 5. Call the gated tool
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"test_tool","arguments":{"message":"Hello!"}}}' | node dist/index.js
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Session Management
- Currently uses "default" session ID for all connections
- In production, would derive from transport/connection ID
- Each session tracks its own acknowledgment state

### Notifications
The server sends two notifications when acknowledgment happens:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/tools/list_changed","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/prompts/list_changed","params":{}}
```

### Error Handling
If you try to call `test_tool` before acknowledging:
```json
{
  "code": -32002,
  "message": "Tool not available",
  "data": {
    "reason": "PRECONDITION_NOT_MET",
    "details": "Please run the 'welcome' prompt and call 'acknowledge_setup' first"
  }
}
```

## Browser Limitation

**Note**: The MCP Inspector in the browser doesn't automatically refresh tool lists when it receives `list_changed` notifications. You must manually click "Reload" after acknowledging. Production MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) should handle this automatically.

## Code Structure

```
src/welcome-gate.ts
├── SessionStore         - Manages per-session state
├── getVisibleTools()    - Returns tools based on acknowledgment
├── getVisiblePrompts()  - Returns available prompts
├── getPromptTemplate()  - Returns prompt content
└── executeTool()        - Executes dynamic tools

src/index.ts
├── Capabilities: listChanged: true for tools & prompts
├── Dynamic tool listing based on session state
├── Notification sending on acknowledgment
└── Prompt handlers for welcome message
```

## Next Steps

This pattern can be extended to:
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Unlock tools in stages
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable tools based on user permissions
3. **Onboarding Flows**: Guide users through complex setups
4. **Safety Gates**: Require confirmation before dangerous operations
5. **A/B Testing**: Show different tools to different sessions

## Summary

✅ **Working**: The welcome gate pattern is fully functional
✅ **Notifications**: Server correctly sends list_changed events  
✅ **Session State**: Per-session tracking implemented
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of pre-gate tool calls
⚠️ **Browser Note**: Manual refresh needed in MCP Inspector

The implementation is clean, follows MCP best practices, and provides a solid foundation for controlling tool exposure based on user interactions!
