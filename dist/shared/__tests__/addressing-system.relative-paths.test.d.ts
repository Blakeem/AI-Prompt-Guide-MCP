/**
 * Tests for relative path handling in addressing system
 *
 * This test suite verifies that the addressing system correctly handles
 * the new relative path structure where user-facing paths are relative
 * to their base folders (docs/ or coordinator/).
 *
 * Path Structure:
 * - Old: /docs/api/auth.md (with base folder prefix)
 * - New: /api/auth.md (relative to docs/)
 * - Physical: .ai-prompt-guide/docs/api/auth.md (unchanged)
