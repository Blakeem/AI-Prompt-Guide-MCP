/**
 * Tests for batch-scoped caching in addressing system
 *
 * This test suite verifies that the AddressCache:
 * 1. Only caches within batch scope (not persistent)
 * 2. Clears cache after batch operations
 * 3. Provides batch statistics for debugging
 * 4. Handles errors gracefully
 * 5. Maintains backward compatibility
