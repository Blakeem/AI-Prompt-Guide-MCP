 * The document analysis functionality has been refactored into focused modules:
 * - index.ts: Main orchestrator and exports
 * - related-docs.ts: Related document discovery
 * - reference-validation.ts: Broken reference detection
 * - keyword-utils.ts: Enhanced keyword extraction and relevance scoring
 * - types.ts: Shared interfaces and error classes
