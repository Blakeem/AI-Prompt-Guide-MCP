# Code Review - AI-Prompt-Guide MCP Server

## Overview

This document defines the code review process for systematic quality assurance of the AI-Prompt-Guide MCP Server codebase. Reviews focus on **functional correctness**, **code readability**, **maintainability**, and **consistency** to ensure the codebase is accessible to all developers.

## Review Scope

- **Primary Focus**: `/src` directory - all TypeScript source files
- **Core Areas**: Functional issues, readability, technical debt, complexity, consistency
- **Out of Scope**: Documentation files, build configs (unless affecting functionality)

## Review Categories

1. **Architecture & Design Patterns** - Design consistency, SOLID principles, separation of concerns
2. **Code Complexity & Readability** - Cyclomatic complexity, function size, naming, clarity
3. **Anti-patterns & Code Smells** - DRY violations, code smells, refactoring opportunities
4. **Core Infrastructure** - Document cache, sections, addressing system, utilities
5. **MCP Tools Layer** - Tool implementations, consistency across tools, error handling
6. **Integration & Response Formatting** - ToolIntegration class, response consistency
7. **Test Quality** - Test coverage, clarity, maintainability, missing edge cases
8. **Error Handling & Resilience** - Error scenarios, boundary conditions, input validation
9. **Performance & Optimization** - Bottlenecks, memory usage, inefficient patterns
10. **Code Consistency** - Naming conventions, patterns, style uniformity

## Review Agent Instructions

### Before Starting Review
1. **Read this document** to understand scope and severity levels
2. **Review your assigned category** and focus areas
3. **Avoid duplication** - check if issue overlaps with other categories
4. **Use consistent reporting format** and severity levels

### Review Process
1. **Stay in your assigned category** - avoid overlapping with other agents
2. **Examine all files** in `/src` relevant to your category
3. **Look for patterns** - issues that appear across multiple files
4. **Consider developer impact** - how does this affect someone working on the code?
5. **Focus on actionable findings** - provide specific, implementable recommendations

### Reporting Standards

#### Severity Levels
- **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Functional bugs, data corruption risk, security vulnerabilities, breaking changes
- **üü° MAJOR**: Significant technical debt, poor readability, design flaws affecting maintainability
- **üü¢ MINOR**: Inconsistencies, minor complexity issues, small refactoring opportunities
- **üìù SUGGESTION**: Best practice recommendations, nice-to-have improvements

#### Finding Format
```markdown
### [SEVERITY] Issue Title - File:Line

**Description**: Clear description of the issue
**Impact**: How this affects the codebase/users/performance
**Recommendation**: Specific actionable fix
**Files Affected**: List of files with this pattern
**Related**: Reference to related findings (if any)
```

#### Evidence Requirements
- **Code snippets** showing the issue
- **Line numbers** for easy location
- **Context** about why this is problematic
- **Specific recommendations** with examples where helpful

### Quality Standards

#### Code Readability
- **Function Complexity**: Keep cyclomatic complexity < 10
- **Function Length**: Prefer functions < 50 lines for readability
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names across codebase
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar problems solved similarly
- **Comments**: Complex logic explained, not obvious code

#### Maintainability
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid code duplication across files
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class has one clear purpose
- **Testability**: Code structure allows easy unit testing
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across modules
- **Type Safety**: Explicit typing, minimal use of `any`

#### Performance & Efficiency
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Avoid O(n¬≤) where O(n) suffices
- **Memory Usage**: No obvious memory leaks or inefficient structures
- **Async Patterns**: Proper async/await, no unnecessary promises
- **Caching**: Appropriate caching without over-engineering

### Files in Scope

#### Core Application Files
- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
