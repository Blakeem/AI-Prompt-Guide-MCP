TWO MODES:
1. Sequential: "/project/tasks.md"
   → Starts first pending/in_progress task
   → Injects main workflow + task workflow + references
   → Use for systematic work through a project

2. Ad-hoc: "/project/tasks.md#implement-auth"
   → Starts ONLY the specified task
   → Injects task workflow ONLY (no main workflow)
   → Use when a specific task was assigned to you

⚠️ IMPORTANT: If you were assigned a specific task, ALWAYS include the full path with #slug!
Example: If assigned "#implement-auth", use "/project/tasks.md#implement-auth"
Otherwise you will start the WRONG TASK!`,
